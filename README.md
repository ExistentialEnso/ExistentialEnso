# Thorne

Hello, I'm **Thorne** a.k.a. **ens0**, a thirty-something Renaissance woman with a diverse array of expertise and successes. Primary focuses are **coding & writing**, with a lot of experience as a tech lead. Always learning, always creating, always building. Dedicated to building a better, more inclusive world for all.

Most active repositories split between this account and [@smolfarm](https://github.com/smolfarm), a studio I co-founded with my girlfriend. Primary languages of focus are **Solidity, TypeScript, and C#.**

Previously, I spent 3 years as a CTO of a Y Combinator company, CrowdMed, that helped patients whose doctors were stumped get answers. I like keeping my hands in the code, even if a savvy leader.
